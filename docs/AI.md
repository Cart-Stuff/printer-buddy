# Printer Buddy AI - failure detection

> **Status:** live. Pick **AI detection: basic** in `./install.sh` (needs a 64-bit system) and the installer
> downloads the newest model by itself. **3) Update** fetches newer models.

Printer Buddy can watch your printer's camera and catch failed prints. While a printer is printing,
it scores each snapshot for these problems (0-100% each, several can be high at once):

| Label | Kind | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| spaghetti | **alert** | print came loose / extruding into the air |
| warping | **alert** | corners lifting off the bed |
| first_layer | **alert** | bad first layer |
| failure | **alert** | a failure the source data didn't name |
| stringing | warning | thin strings between parts |
| blob | warning | blobs, zits, under-extrusion |
| crack | warning | layer splits / cracks |

**Alert** labels can notify you and pause the print. **Warnings** only show on the card.
It only acts when a problem **holds for several checks in a row**, so one odd frame won't pause a good print.

## Download

Models are published as releases on this repo, tagged `ai-<model>`:

- **All AI models:** [Releases tagged `ai-`](https://github.com/sterling5241/printer-buddy/releases?q=ai-&expanded=true)
- **Current:** [`ai-basic-v1`](https://github.com/sterling5241/printer-buddy/releases/tag/ai-basic-v1)

Each release has two files:

- `printer-buddy-basic.onnx` - the model (about 17 MB)
- `model.json` - labels, image size, default threshold, test results and a sha256 checksum

The installer downloads the newest one for you when you pick **AI detection: basic**.

## How it watches

- While a printer is **printing**, it checks the camera every 10 seconds. When it isn't printing, it doesn't watch,
  and the printer page says so.
- It alerts when an alert label scores **60% or more for 3 checks in a row** (about 30 seconds), then waits
  **10 minutes** before alerting again. All of these can be changed under **AI** in the dashboard.
- Each printer has its own mode in its menu and on its page: **Alert only** (default), **Alert + auto-pause**, or **Off**.
- **Check now** on a printer's page scores the camera once, any time, without alerting or pausing. Handy for testing.
- The AI judges what the camera sees: point it at **the print on the bed**, not just the nozzle.

## Help improve the AI (optional, off by default)

The next model learns from real printers. Printer Buddy keeps a few labelled photos **on your box**:

- after an alert it asks **"Was it really a failure?"** (and if yes, **how bad, 1-10**)
- 3 snapshots per print (10%, 50%, 90%), which become **OK** when the print finishes
- the last snapshot of a failed or cancelled print, for you to label
- anything you save yourself with **Save for AI…** on a printer's page

You can see, label and delete all of them under **AI > Photos for AI**. **Nothing leaves your box** unless you tick
**Help improve the AI**. If you do:

- only **labelled** photos are sent, one at a time, at most 50 a day
- each is shrunk to 640 px and re-saved, so no location or camera details
- sent with your **box number** (the random ID in your share links), the label, how bad it was, and what the AI scored
  at the time; **not** your name, address or printer list (your internet address is only used to count the daily
  limit for 2 days and is never stored with the photo)
- they go to a **private** dataset used only to train Printer Buddy's AI models
- once sent, the photo is deleted from your box; untick the box any time and nothing more is sent

Photos show whatever your printer camera sees, so keep people and private things out of its view.

## Was it right?

Every labelled photo records whether the AI got it right: **right**, **false alarm** (it flagged a problem, you said
OK) or **missed** (it said OK, you labelled a failure). **AI > Photos for AI** shows the score on your printers,
e.g. *basic-v1 on your printers: 47 right · 2 false alarms · 1 missed (94% right)*.

## Current model: `basic-v1`

- MobileNetV3-Large, 224 x 224 input, ONNX, runs on a CPU (about 7 ms per image on a PC; a Pi 4 is slower but fine for a check every few seconds)
- Trained on 31,934 images, tested on 2,907 held-out images
- Default alert threshold **0.6**

Test results (alert labels, per frame, before the "hold for several checks" rule):

| Threshold | Failures caught | Correct when it alarms | False alarms on frames without an alert problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 92.2% | 95.7% | 4.0% |
| **0.6** | **91.5%** | **96.2%** | **3.5%** |
| 0.7 | 90.6% | 96.5% | 3.2% |
| 0.8 | 89.3% | 97.0% | 2.6% |

### Limits (read this)

- The test images come from the **same kinds of sources** as the training images. On your own
  printers, cameras and lighting it **will do worse** than the table above. Tell us about misses and false alarms.
- **first_layer** looks perfect in testing but most of its images come from one dataset, so it may be
  recognising that camera rather than the defect. Don't trust it yet.
- **failure** is a vague label from datasets that only said "fail"; it scores poorly on its own.
  Real failures are usually caught by spaghetti or warping anyway.
- Clean "OK" prints are only about 11% of the data, so false alarms are the main thing we're working on.

## How it was made

1. Twelve public datasets were downloaded, their labels mapped onto ours, and duplicates removed
   (4,766 copies) to make one dataset: 34,841 images.
2. Every image was resized (max 640 px) and given image-level labels. Box sets: any box = that label.
   Folder sets: the folder name is the label. Images with no problem are "OK".
3. A MobileNetV3-Large (starting from ImageNet weights) was trained for 30 epochs in Google Colab;
   the best epoch (24) was kept and exported to ONNX.

"Images used" is before duplicates were removed. Several sets share images, so the final dataset is smaller.

### Ideas

- [PrintGuard](https://github.com/oliverbravery/PrintGuard) by Oliver Bravery (GPL-2.0) - showed that
  a small, fast model on a Pi works, and the "hold for a while before acting" alert idea. Its list of
  datasets pointed us to several of the sets above. **No PrintGuard code or model is used.**
